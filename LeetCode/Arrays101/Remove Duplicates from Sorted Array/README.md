### 문제 설명

<p>Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.</p>
<p>The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.</p>
<p>Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.</p>
<p>More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result.</p>
<p>It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.</p>
<p>Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
