### 문제 설명

<p>You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.</p>
<p>Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.</p>
<p>The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1.</p>
<p>To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored.</p>
<p>nums2 has a length of n.</p>
