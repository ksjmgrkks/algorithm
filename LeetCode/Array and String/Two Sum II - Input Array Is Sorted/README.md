### 문제 설명

<p>Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,</p>
<p>find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.</p>
<p>Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.</p>
<p>Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2,</p>
<p>added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.</p>
<p>The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.</p>
<p>You may not use the same element twice.</p>
<p>Your solution must use only constant extra space.</p>
